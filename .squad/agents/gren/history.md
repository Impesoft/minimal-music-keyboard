# Gren — History

## Core Context (Project Day 1)

**Project:** Minimal Music Keyboard — lightweight WinUI3 MIDI player for Windows 11
**Requested by:** Ward Impe
**Stack:** WinUI3 (Windows App SDK), C#/.NET
**Primary MIDI device:** Arturia KeyLab 88 MkII

**What it does:**
- Lives in the Windows 11 system tray (notification area)
- Listens continuously to a configured MIDI device in the background
- Routes MIDI note/CC/PC input to a selected software instrument (soundfonts/synthesis)
- Users switch instruments via MIDI commands — no need to open the settings UI
- Settings page: MIDI device selection, instrument configuration, startup options
- Must be memory-leak-free — will run continuously for hours/days
- Exit option from tray context menu

**Gren's architectural focus areas:**
- All IDisposable chains are complete and verified
- No lingering event subscriptions (event handler leaks are a common WinUI3 trap)
- MIDI device handles properly released on device disconnect or app exit
- Audio engine teardown sequence is correct and tested
- Thread safety between MIDI, audio, and UI threads
